# [An overview of the situation](https://nextstrain.org/ncov)

This narrative is a draft -- it is not intended for public release yet!

## An overview of the current situation

* See [this update](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00154-w) from nature news.
* Current confirmet cases: 555 (17 fatalities). ([data source](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html), 2020-01-23)

# [Phylogenetic analysis](https://nextstrain.org/ncov?d=tree)

* We currently see little genetic diversity across the nCov sequences with 8 out of 24 sequences being genetically identical.
* Low genetic diversity across these sequences suggest that the most recent common ancestor of all nCov sequences was fairly recent. 
* At the moment, most mutations that can be observed are singletons -- that is they are unique to individual genomes. However, we are starting to see come clustering which we will explore in the following slides.

# [Potential within-family transmission I](https://nextstrain.org/ncov?d=tree&f_city=Shenzhen)

Of the four isolates from Shenzhen (Southeastern China) we see three isolates which are genetically identical and all share mutations unique to those 3 samples.
These samples have been indicated as putative within-family transmission via epidemiological data _to do - cite GISAID_

# [Potential within-family transmission II](https://nextstrain.org/ncov?d=tree&f_city=Zhuhai)

* Less clear whether this is within-family _need to check GISAID_

# [Cases outside china](https://nextstrain.org/ncov?c=country&d=tree,map)

There are reported nCoV cases in South Korea (n=1), USA (n=1), Thailand (n=2) and Japan (n=2).
These cases are all linked to Wuhan and there is no evidence for transmission of nCov in these countries (true?).
The only currently available sequence data is for the two cases from Thailand, which are coloured here in Red.
These samples are genetically identical to sequences isolated in Wuhan, as well as 6 other genomes sequences from Chinese cases.

Here, we use this star-like structure along with a Poisson distribution of mutations through time to estimate the time of the most recent common ancestor of sequenced viruses:

We would like to acknowledge the amazing and timely work done by all scientists involved in this outbreak, but particularly those working in China.
Only through the rapid sharing of genomic data and metadata are analyses such as these possible.

.

The nCoV genomes were generously shared by scientists at the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center & School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai, China (Wuhan-Hu-1/2019), at the National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, China CDC, Beijing, China (Wuhan/IVDC-HB-01/2019, Wuhan/IVDC-HB-04/2020, Wuhan/IVDC-HB-05/2019) at the Institute of Pathogen Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China (Wuhan/IPBCAMS-WH-01/2019, Wuhan/IPBCAMS-WH-02/2019, Wuhan/IPBCAMS-WH-03/2019, Wuhan/IPBCAMS-WH-04/2019), at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, China (Wuhan/WIV02/2019, Wuhan/WIV04/2019, Wuhan/WIV05/2019, Wuhan/WIV06/2019, Wuhan/WIV07/2019), at the Department of Microbiology, Zhejiang Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Hangzhou, China (Zhejiang/WZ-01/2020, Zhejiang/WZ-02/2020), at the Guangdong Provincial Center for Diseases Control and Prevention (Guangdong/20SF012/2020, Guangdong/20SF013/2020, Guangdong/20SF014/2020, Guangdong/20SF025/2020, Guangdong/20SF028/2020, Guangdong/20SF040/2020) and at the Department of Medical Sciences, National Institute of Health, Nonthaburi, Thailand (Nonthaburi/61/2020, Nonthaburi/74/2020) via GISAID.
