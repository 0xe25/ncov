# [Coronaviruses](https://nextstrain.org/ncov)

```auspiceMainDisplayMarkdown


Coronaviruses are members of a diverse species of (+)ssRNA viruses which have a history of causing respiratory infections in humans.

#### SARS-CoV
The most well known of these is the SARS (SARS-CoV) outbreak in 2002-03 which spread around the world and resulted in [over 8000 cases and 774 deaths](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/10/sars-virus-bats-china-severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome), with a fatality rate of around 9-11%.
SARS was 

#### Seasonal CoV
However it's not fair to categorise all coronaviruses as deadly as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
There are now [seven different groups of coronaviruses](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/types.html) which can cause infections in humans, with four of them considered "seasonal" and commonly infecting humans each year.
Compared with SARS, these seasonal coronavirus strans are ["much more prevalent, much less severe, and common causes of influenza‚Äêlike illness (ILI)"](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5820427/).
In fact, [5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2879166/) - [12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5820427/)% of all ILI cases test positive for coronaviruses, so they are rather common.

#### MERS-CoV

In 2012, a novel coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causing severe respiratory symptoms was identified. MERS has resulted in fatalities comparable to SARS, however the transmission route of MERS is very different. Whereas SARS was effeciently spread from one human to another, human MERS infections were generally a result of independent zoonoses (animal to human transmissions) from camels (see [Dudas _et al._](https://elifesciences.org/articles/31257) for more information).

#### Animal reservoirs
Coronaviruses infect a wide range of animals, and the human outbreaks described above are a result of one or more "jumps" from these animal reservoirs into the human population. 
SARS was originally believed to have arrived in the human population from Masked palm civets, but is now considered to have arrived [from horseshoe bats](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1006698).


#### Human to Human transmission
The ability for different lineages to be transmitted between humans is extremely important to understand the potential ramifications of an outbreak.
Due to the ability of SARS to spread between humans and the high case fatality rate, SARS (or a SARS-like virus) is considered a [global public health threat](https://www.who.int/whr/2007/overview/en/index1.html) by the WHO.

In December 2019, a new illness was first detected in Wuhan, China.
We now know this to another outbreak of coronavirus in humans (the 7th), and is being called nCoV (novel coronavirus).

As of January 23rd, over 570 cases and 17 deaths [have been reported](https://flutrackers.com/forum/forum/-2019-ncov-new-coronavirus/china-2019-ncov/821830-china-2019-ncov-cases-in-several-provinces-and-cities-including-confirmed-health-care-workers-at-least-17-deaths/page31).
It's still too early to know the case fataility rate, but early indications are that it is less than SARS-CoV.
The case counts are dramatically rising in part due to increased surveillance and testing, with 131 new cases reported yesterday (Jan 22nd).

While the outbreak seems to be centered in Wuhan, which is now [under quarantine](https://twitter.com/PDChina/status/1220060879112282117), the virus has spread throughout China and abroad, including Hong Kong, Macau, Thailand, USA, Japan and South Korea.


The origin of the virus is still unclear, however [genomic analyis](http://virological.org/t/ncovs-relationship-to-bat-coronaviruses-recombination-signals-no-snakes/331) suggests nCoV is a recombinant of viruses previously identified in bats.
It is plausable that there were other intermediate animal transmissions before the introduction into humans.

#### Nextstrain narratives

The following pages contain anaylsis performed using [nextstrain](https://nextstrain.org).
Scrolling through the left hand sidebar will reveal paragraphs of text with a corresponding visualisation of the genomic data on the right hand side.

To have full genomes of a novel & large RNA virus this quickly is a remarkable achievement.
These analyses have been made possible by the rapid and open sharing of genomic data and interpretations by scientists all around the world (see the final slide for a visualisation of sequencing authorship).

# [Phylogenetic analysis](https://nextstrain.org/ncov?d=tree)

Here we present a maximum likelihood phylogeny of 24 strains of nCoV that have been publically shared.
Information on how the analysis was performed is available [in this GitHub repository](github.com/nextstrain/ncov).
Note that INDELS as well as putative 3' and 5' sequencing errors have been masked for the purposes of this analysis.

.

The colours represent the city of isolation, with the x-axis representing nucleotide divergence (you can hover over the branches to see which mutations are present on a given branch.)

.

* We currently see little genetic diversity across the nCov sequences with 8 out of 24 sequences being genetically identical.

* Low genetic diversity across these sequences suggest that the most recent common ancestor of all nCov sequences was fairly recent. 

* At the moment, most mutations that can be observed are singletons -- that is they are unique to individual genomes.
Given the mutation rate of coronaviruses and the recent introduction of nCoV this neither supports nor ruels out human-human transmissions.

* There are two exapmles of clustering, which we will explore in the following slides.

# [Potential within-family transmission I](https://nextstrain.org/ncov?d=tree&f_city=Shenzhen)

Of the four isolates from Shenzhen (Southeastern China) we see three isolates which are genetically identical and all share mutations unique to those three samples.
These three samples are [known to come from a single family](https://twitter.com/JingLu_LuJing/status/1220143773532880896) and likely represent human to human transmission.

# [Potential within-family transmission II](https://nextstrain.org/ncov?d=tree&f_city=Zhuhai)

Similarly, there are two genomically-identical isolates from Zhuhai (Southeastern China) which form a cluster, sharing one unique mutation seen in no other isolate.
These two cases are also [known to come from a single family](https://twitter.com/JingLu_LuJing/status/1220143773532880896) again indicating likely human to human transmission.

# [Cases outside china](https://nextstrain.org/ncov?c=country&d=tree,map)

There are reported nCoV cases in Thailand, USA, Japan and South Korea.
These cases are all linked to Wuhan and there is no evidence for transmission of nCov in these countries (true? TODO- check).

.


The only currently available sequence data is for the two cases from Thailand, which are coloured here in Red.
These samples are genetically identical to sequences isolated in Wuhan, as well as 6 other genomes sequences from Chinese cases.

We would like to acknowledge the amazing and timely work done by all scientists involved in this outbreak, but particularly those working in China.
Only through the rapid sharing of genomic data and metadata are analyses such as these possible.
